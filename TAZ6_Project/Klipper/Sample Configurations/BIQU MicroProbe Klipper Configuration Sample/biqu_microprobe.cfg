## --- BIQU Microprobe Klipper configuration ---
# Not much different from a standard probe config. The
# main difference compared to most probes is to disable
# deactivating the probe (PROBE_UP) after each sample
#
# You can either copy pasta this directly or import
# into your config.yml using [include microprobe.cfg]
#
# Note: if you are changing from a bltouch or one of its
# clones, remove/comment out the [bltouch] config!
# That also includes any auto generated config stored
# at the bottom by the PROBE_CALIBRATE command
#
# Note: the current control and sensor pin values are
# configured for the 'BTT SKR E3 mini V2' controller 
# board. You may need to update these values depending
# on your controller board model.
#
# Update (2023-10-17): This config is configured for
# the V1 microprobe. V2 users must update the 
# polarity of the sensor pin in the config to be 
# pull-down (^!) not pull up (^)
